# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? *The `each` method could be useful any time you wanted to apply the same action to every element in an array. For example, the each method could be used to send an email addressed to each person on a mailing list.*
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? *I still need to practice and learn different array methods and the order in which to perform methods to achieve the desired result. I'll do this by firstly reviewing methods and their uses and then by completing practice problems and assignments.*
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? *Trial and error. Especially on challege three I tried a number of different ways and order-of-operations before getting it right. It was a brief but informative moment of productive struggle.*
